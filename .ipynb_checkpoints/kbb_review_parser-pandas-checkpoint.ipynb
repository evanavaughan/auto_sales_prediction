I t has been almost five months and no answer from Honda yet. They told me that this is not a major safety issue. They also told me that I CAN GO AND REPORT THIS TO THE BBB AUTO. the receptionist for Honda motor company told me that Honda company is very strong and reporting issue like that will never effect Honda reputation  I was surprise to hear that.
